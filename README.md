## 🌍 What's This?

Ever been in a Slack chat trying to schedule a meeting with teammates
spread across the globe, and someone says "Let's meet at 9am!" leaving
you thinking "9am WHERE?!"

Timezoner is your friendly neighborhood timezone converter, built for
distributed teams who are tired of doing timezone math in their heads!

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Smart search (type "turkey" instead of remembering
  "Europe/Istanbul")
- 🎯 Quick timezone comparison
- 📊 Visual time alignment (see how times line up across zones)
- 💾 Remembers your selected timezones
- 🌙 Works with your system theme

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

## 🎯 Why I Built This

Working with a globally distributed team means you're always doing
timezone math in your head. After one too many "Sorry, I thought you
meant 9am MY time" moments, I decided to build something to make our
lives easier.
